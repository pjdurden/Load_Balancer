# High-Level Design Overview for Load Balancer

## Introduction

This document provides a high-level overview of the Load Balancer architecture, focusing on its core functionalities and interactions with various components. The Load Balancer is engineered to manage incoming requests effectively, distributing them across multiple backend servers to achieve optimal performance and reliability. 

## Architecture Overview

The architecture of the Load Balancer consists of several key components that work together to ensure efficient request processing:

```
+----------------+                +----------------+
|    Client      |                |   Backend      |
|                |                |    Server      |
+----------------+                +----------------+
         |                               ^
         v                               |
+----------------+                +----------------+
|    Listener     |-------------->|  Request       |
|                |                |   Forwarder    |
+----------------+                +----------------+
         |                               ^
         |                               |
         |                               |
         v                               |
+----------------+                +----------------+
| LoadBalancer   |                |   ServerPool   |
|                |                |                |
+----------------+                +----------------+
         |                               ^
         |                               |
         v                               |
+----------------+                +----------------+
|   Scheduler     |-------------->| SchedulingAlgo  |
|                |                | (e.g., Round   |
+----------------+                | Robin, Random)  |
                                 +----------------+
```

### Components

1. **Client**
   - Represents the entities sending requests to the Load Balancer. This could be web browsers, mobile applications, or any service needing backend access.

2. **Listener**
   - **Functionality:**
     - Listens for incoming requests on a specified port.
     - Passes requests to the Load Balancer for processing.

3. **LoadBalancer**
   - **Functionality:**
     - Coordinates the overall request processing workflow.
     - Manages the request forwarding and scheduling components.
     - Implements the main logic for distributing requests among backend servers.

4. **Request Forwarder**
   - **Functionality:**
     - Forwards requests to the appropriate backend server based on the scheduling algorithm selected.
     - Retrieves responses from the servers and returns them to the clients.

5. **ServerPool**
   - **Functionality:**
     - Maintains a dynamic list of active backend servers.
     - Provides methods to add and remove servers as needed.

6. **Scheduler**
   - **Functionality:**
     - Manages the load-balancing strategy.
     - Determines which server to forward the request to based on the selected scheduling algorithm.
     - Allows for dynamic switching between algorithms at runtime.

7. **Scheduling Algorithm**
   - **Functionality:**
     - An abstract representation of various load-balancing strategies (e.g., Round Robin, Random Selection).
     - Each algorithm implements the logic for selecting the appropriate backend server.

## Key Features

- **Scalability**: The architecture is designed to scale horizontally by adding more backend servers to handle increased load without altering the core logic.
- **Flexibility**: Supports multiple load-balancing algorithms, enabling seamless switching based on operational requirements.
- **Resilience**: Built-in error handling and server health checks ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

## Conclusion

The high-level design of the Load Balancer provides a robust foundation for managing incoming requests efficiently. By focusing on modularity and scalability, the architecture is prepared to meet current and future demands while ensuring optimal performance.
